# Spelunky-Like
A Spelunky-Esque Terrain Generation System, Custom Character Controller and Inventory System in Unity

## Features
* Mesh-based chunked terrain system with Spelunky-style randomised room generation generated from PNGs
* State-based character controller with animation, walk, jump, wall-hang support
* Inventory system with usable items in a similar vein to those featured in games such as Minecraft (multiple uses, stacks, can be dropped/thrown and will pool near each other)
